I am a recent graduate of the Software Engineering Bootcamp at Flatiron School, where I spent 15 weeks refining my skills as a full-stack developer. I am eager to find my place on a collaborative team of talented individuals where I can continue expanding my knowledge and developing new skills. 👩‍💻 

When I'm not coding new projects, you can find me hiking and exploring nature 🥾 , curled up reading a mystery novel 📚 , or listening to a true-crime podcast 🕵️‍♀️.
